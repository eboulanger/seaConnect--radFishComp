Reading pedigree information from [ dip_adaptive_iter2.tfam ] 
267 individuals read from [ dip_adaptive_iter2.tfam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 267 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 267 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 267 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ dip_adaptive_iter2.nosex ]
715 (of 715) markers to be included from [ dip_adaptive_iter2.tped ]
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 715 SNPs
267 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.986229
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 715 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 267 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 267 of unspecified sex
